# SIMPRO
Sistem Informasi Monitoring Proyek

## Explanation
Built based on feedbacks from my field supervisor during internship at BRI Primary Satellite Control Facility. The web applications offers several features such as:
- Ability to create new project and add personnel members to the project.
- Add and edit subtasks for the project.
- Show overall projectâ€™s progress based on the subtasks done and on-progress ratio.
- Change subtasks status between New, Ongoing, Finished, and Revision (a la Bitrix24 Kanban board).
- Upload files in the project page
